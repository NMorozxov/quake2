# quake2
This is patched source code of Quake 2 released by id Software
- icculus.org patch
- patches from FreeBSD port collection
- Nikolay Morozov SCO port

This source code is compiling under Linux,FreeBSD,SCO,Solaris and posible IRIX (look src/irix), and of course must compile under Win32

In 2010 year this source code is hosted at Planet Quake by me
http://planetquake.gamespy.com/View1b71.html?view=Quake2.Detail&id=464421&id=1309
After 10 years planet quake doen't works properly so I decided to host it here at github.
